        description: `A massively multiagent environment with progression and an agent-driven economy. By Joseph Suarez.

A spiritual successor to Neural MMO 1-2. Explore, forage, fight, and trade in a massive procedurally generated open world. It's playable and quite fun, so I'm not going to tell you much. Your combat and profession levels are displayed overhead. The max in this demo is 40 for each. It starts off hard but you will discover some tricks... probably. Good luck!

This environment supports configurable difficulty and scale. We are running a medium size map (512x512), but with only 8 agents for browser compatibility. The same map runs 1024 locally. 

SHADERS ARE BROKEN ON MOBILE. I know. I will fix them soon.

Use weapons and physics to push your opponents into a red death walls to kill them. Yellow walls are bouncy, blue walls are nothing special.

Pickup green weapon tiles to switch weapons. Movement is slow, but you can use recoil to move faster, dodge, and more, but it must be managed carefully.

The white ring inside your player is an energy meter, you can use it to brake or to charge bursts, a devastating explosion that can push players and projectiles away. If your burst touches a solid wall it'll push you away from the wall.

This game is best played with a controller, but mouse and keyboard works.

This is a 5v5 mirror match with 5 unique characters, each with three unique skills. Your objective is to destroy the enemy base on the other side of the map. There game map has three lanes, each of which contains three towers that will automatically attach nearby enemies. Waves of minions will spawn from each team's base and travel down each lane, fighting each other and towers along the way. In the current version, enemy units are controlled by a simple scripted AI. This environment can also be trained with self-play.
