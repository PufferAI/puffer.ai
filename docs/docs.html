                <h1>Installation</h1>
            </header>

            <h2>Pip</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Install nvcc</strong> for faster training. We ship a custom advantage function kernel, and you'll only get the CPU version without it.</li>
                <li><strong>Use <span style="color:cyan">--no-build-isolation</span></strong> to prevent pip from fetching a different Torch version during kernel compilation.
                <li><strong>Omit <span style="color:cyan">[train]</span></strong> if you just want our environments/wrappers without PyTorch</li>
                <li><strong>Install environments</strong> with <span style="color:cyan">[atari,procgen]</span> etc. Ocean is included by default.</li>
                <li><strong><span style="color:red">Avoid Conda</span></strong> because it builds slow env code. Use UV if you really want venvs instead of containers.</li>
            </ul>

            <pre><code>pip install pufferlib[train] --no-build-isolation</code></pre>

            <h2>Docker</h2>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/pufferai/puffertank" target="_blank">PufferTank</a> is a prebuilt GPU Docker image for PufferLib. We use it for all our dev. VSCode users can install the Dev Container plugin + Docker Desktop and just open the repo. You can also set up with CLI as below. Neovim (btw) is preinstalled.</p>

               <h1>About PufferLib</h1>
           </header>

               <p>PufferLib is the reinforcement learning library I wish existed during my PhD. It started as a compatibility layer to make working with complex environments a breeze. Now, it's a high-performance toolkit for research and industry with optimized parallel simulation, training at millions of steps per second, and core algorithm improvements from our own research.</p>

                <h2>Emulation</h2>
                <p>Complex environments may have heirarchical observations and actions, variable numbers of agents, and other quirks that make them difficult to work with and incompatible with standard reinforcement learning libraries. This was the initial motivation for PufferLib. The idea is to make every environment <i>emulate</i> the structure of simpler environments that most original RL tooling was written for. We flatten Gym/Gymnasium/PettingZoo spaces in our wrappers and unflatten them just in time for the model forward pass. This means you don't have to keep track of structured data during vectorization, in your experience buffers, or anywhere else, allowing for simpler and faster code. We also apply extra compatibility checks and pad multiagent environments to a fixed agent count. Under the hood, our wrappers maintain the Gym/Gymnasium/PettingZoo API using a stricter subset of available spaces, so you can still use them with other libraries outside of PufferLib.</p>
 
                <h2>Vectorization</h2>
                <p>In RL, vectorization refers to the process of simulating multiple copies of an environment in parallel. Our Multiprocessing backend is fast -- much faster than Gymnasium's in most cases. Atari runs 50-60% faster synchronous and 5x faster async by our latest benchmark, and some environments like NetHack can be 10x faster even synchronous, with no API changes. Our vectorization works on almost any Gym/Gymnasium/PettingZoo environment after applying our 1-line emulation wrapper. PufferLib outperforms other vectorization implementations using the following optimizations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Python implementation of EnvPool.</strong> Simulates more envs than are needed per batch and returns batches of observations as soon as they are ready. Requires using the async send/recv instead of the sync step API.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple environments per worker.</strong> Important for fast environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Shared memory.</strong> Unlike Gymnasium's implementation, we use a single buffer that is shared across environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Shared flags.</strong> Workers busy-wait on an unlocked flag instead of signaling via pipes or queues. This virtually eliminates interprocess communication overhead. Pipes are used once per episode to communicate aggregated infos.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero-copy batching.</strong> Because we use a single buffer for shared memory, we can return observations from contiguous subsets of workers without ever copying observations. Only does not work for full-async mode.</li>
                <li><strong>Native multiagent support.</strong> It's not an extra wrapper or slow bolt-on feature. PufferLib treats single-agent and multi-agent environments the same. API differences are handled at the emulation level.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>PuffeRL</h2>
        <p>PuffeRL is our training algorithm. It's based on CleanRL's PPO + LSTM but with a ton of improvements, including core algorithm changes based on our own research. We have no plans to ship a collection of standard implementations. Instead, our goal is to continue improving our one core algorithm through research and rigorous testing on all of Ocean. See our Blog for research updates!</p>

        <h2>Policies</h2>
        <p>We don't have a policy API. You just write normal PyTorch code. We do provide some defaults and surrounding tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PyTorch observation unflattening:</strong> A batched inversion function for the flattening applied to structured observation spaces by our emulation layer</li>
            <li><strong>Default policies:</strong> A small collection of broadly useful networks. These include MLPs and CNNs. You can also refer to all of the models used as defaults by our Ocean environments.</li>
            <li><strong>LSTM Integration:</strong> Break your <code>forward()</code> function into <code>encode_observations()</code> and <code>decode_actions()</code> and our LSTM wrapper will handle recurrance for you. We have a major optimization here that uses LSTMCell during rollouts and LSTM during training for up to 3x faster inference.</li>
        </ul>

            <h1>Writing Your Own 1M+ SPS Environment</h1>
        </header>

        <p>Ocean environments are written with the PufferEnv API. It's a vector format very similar to Gymnasium's VectorEnv, but with native multiagent support. Writing your own is a great way to learn and a great way to contribute to PufferLib. PR something cool to have it reviewed live on stream! Here's a pure Python environment using this format: <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib/blob/3.0/pufferlib/ocean/pysquared/pysquared.py">pysquared.py</a></p>

        <p> If you're familiar with Gymnasium/PettingZoo, you'll notice that this is almost identical. The main difference is that observations, actions, rewards, etc. are initialized from this <i>buf</i> object. All operations happen in-place to avoid creating and copying redundant arrays. Our vectorization passes in slices of shared memory during multiprocessing, so your environment is storing observations directly to a batch on the main process. Note that this means calling <i>step</i> again will overwrite your observations etc. from the previous call.</p>

        <p>The above environment runs at several hundred thousand steps/second, but pure Python quickly becomes a bottleneck as environments become more complex. Below is the exact same code written in C that runs over 100M sps: <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib/blob/3.0/pufferlib/ocean/squared/squared.h">squared.h</a></p>

        <p>Using our standard 2-core double-buffered multiprocessing settings, this environment trains at 4M steps/second while the pure Python version only trains at 400k. There are a few more steps to bind to PufferLib, though. Add a main in a separate .c so you can demo the code and work in C locally without having to compile through Python: <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib/blob/3.0/pufferlib/ocean/squared/squared.c">squared.c</a></p>

        <p>Now you have to bind to Python. We provide a short Python C API wrapper for this. All you have to do is write a short binding file that passes initialization args from Python and logs back from C: <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib/blob/3.0/pufferlib/ocean/squared/binding.c">binding.c</a></p>

        <p>You can now compile the environment as a Python C extension. If you are using a fork of PufferLib, setup.py will automatically look for <i>binding.c</i>. Ensure you get the latest build with:</p>

        <pre><code>python setup.py build_ext --inplace --force</code></pre>

        <p>To use your new environment from Python, set it up as a PufferEnv: <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib/blob/3.0/pufferlib/ocean/squared/squared.py">squared.py</a></p>

        <p>And finally, if you want to expose your environment to our trainer, add a line to <i>ocean/environment.py</i> and add a .ini file for your environment to <i>pufferlib/config/ocean</i>: <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib/blob/3.0/pufferlib/config/ocean/squared.ini">squared.ini</a></p>

        <p>Your environment is now available just like any other Ocean environment:</p>

        <pre><code>puffer train puffer_squared</code></pre>

        <p> We suggest writing your whole environment in C first. Compile with script/build_ocean.sh. <env_name> local to enable address sanitizer. This will catch most indexing and overflow bugs. If your env works in C but not when you bind to Python, you can usually get a stack track as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>DEBUG=1 python setup.py build_ext --inplace --force
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=None LD_PRELOAD=$(gcc -print-file-name=libasan.so) python3.12 -m pufferlib.pufferl train <env_name> --train.device cpu --vec.backend Serial</code></pre>

        <p>You do have to have your compiler and asan set up correctly. This is done for you in PufferTank. You can also set breakpoints from Python into C with gdb:</p>

        <pre><code>gdb --args python3.12 -m pufferlib.pufferl train <env_name> --train.device cpu --vec.backend Serial</code></pre>

        <p>Here's a checklist of common bugs if your env is not training:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Zero or incorrect observations/actions:</b> Ensure the data type and shapes used in the Python spaces and observation/action buffers match the types you've defined in C</li>
            <li><b>Incorrect or missing resets:</b> Your environment should handle its own resets internally. For envs that never reset, it is often useful to respawn agents if they are stuck (e.g. no reward for 500 steps)</li>
            <li><b>Not zeroing reward or terminals:</b> If you don't zero out rewards, they will retain their value from the previous step. Ditto for terminals. Zero them at the start of c_step to be safe. A single memset will do it for multiagent envs</li>
            <li><b>Manually inspect data scale:</b> You want observations and rewards to be roughly in the range of -1 to 1. </li>
            <li><b>Incorrect binding args:</b> Ensure your binding sets the same args as your .c file does. Call your init function if you have one.</b>
        </ul>

        <p>There's also second tutorial environment called <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib/blob/3.0/pufferlib/ocean/target">Target</a>. It's multi-agent with a continuous state space and multi-discrete actions. It's commented like Squared, which is also in the repo. Star on your way in to support! When you're ready to write your own environment, you can use this <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib/blob/3.0/pufferlib/ocean/target">template</a> as a starting point. Set it up as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>cp -r pufferlib/ocean/template pufferlib/ocean/your_env_name
grep -rin --include=*.{h,c,py} template pufferlib/ocean/template</code></pre>

        <p>Replace instances of "template" and "Template" shown with your environment name. Also copy the .ini file from pufferlib/config/ocean/template.ini and add a line for your environment to pufferlib/ocean/environment.py. You can set up outside of PufferLib, but this lets you use our extension compilation.</p>

                </header>

                <p>You can use any well-behaved environment with PufferLib via a 1-line wrapper. These are just the environments we have gotten around to binding manually. A lot of environments are not well behaved and subtly deviate from the Gymnasium/PettingZoo API, or they use obscure features that most libraries are not designed to handle. Our bindings just help clean this up a bit. Plus, we add any tricky system package dependencies to PufferTank. Feel free to PR new bindings or fixes for existing ones!</p>
